This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Description

This app will allow the user to track in real time the evolution of the COVID-19 all over the world. It has been built following the YouTube tutorial of JavaScript Mastery (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJlrj3Y6Ls) and I used it to go deep into React. Making this project I've learnt also how to use Material UI, Charts.js, React Hooks, Async/Await syntax.
